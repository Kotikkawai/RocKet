          <h1>The internet</h1>
          <div class="info-content">
            <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
            <p>
              The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It
              began as an academic research project in 1969, and became a global
              commercial network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more than 2
              billion people around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the
              internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of
              different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate
              voluntary interconnection agreements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed,
              the web has become so popular that many people incorrectly treat
              the internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is
              just one of many internet applications. Other popular Internet
              applications include email and BitTorrent.
            </p>
            <h2>Where is the internet?</h2>
            <p>The internet has three basic parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes
                  and small businesses to the internet. Currently, about 60
                  percent of residential internet connections in the United
                  States are provided by cable TV companies such as Comcast and
                  Time Warner. Of the remaining 40 percent, a growing fraction
                  use new fiber optic cables, most of which are part of
                  Verizon’s FiOS program or AT&T’s U-Verse. Finally, a
                  significant but shrinking number use outdated DSL service
                  provided over telephone cables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last mile also includes the towers that allow people to
                  access the internet with their cell phones. Wireless internet
                  service accounts for a large and growing share of all internet
                  usage.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and
                host online apps and content. Some are owned by large companies
                such as Google and Facebook. Others are commercial facilities
                that provide service to many smaller websites. Data centers have
                very fast internet connections, allowing them to serve many
                users simultaneously. Data centers can be located anywhere in
                the world, but they are often located in remote areas where land
                and electricity are cheap. For example, Google, Facebook, and
                Microsoft have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.
              </li>
              <li>
                The backbone consists of long-distance networks — mostly on
                fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and
                consumers. The backbone market is highly competitive. Backbone
                providers frequently connect their networks together at internet
                exchange points, usually located in major cities. Establishing a
                presence at IEPs makes it much easier for backbone providers to
                improve their connections to others.

              The internet began as ARPANET, an academic research network that
              was funded by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency
              (ARPA, now DARPA). The project was led by Bob Taylor, an ARPA
              administrator, and the network was built by the consulting firm of
              Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1973, software engineers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn began work on
              the next generation of networking standards for the ARPANET. These
              standards, known as TCP/IP, became the foundation of the modern
              internet. ARPANET switched to using TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 1980s, funding for the internet shifted from the
              military to the National Science Foundation. The NSF funded the
              long-distance networks that served as the internet’s backbone from
              1981 until 1994. In 1994, the Clinton Administration turned
              control over the internet backbone to the private sector. It has
              been privately operated and funded ever since.

            </div>
            <p>
              Former Vice President Al Gore is frequently quoted as claiming
              credit for the invention of the internet, but what he actually
              said in a 1999 CNN interview was “I took the initiative in
              creating the internet.” Gore was widely mocked for this statement.
              But the men who did invent the internet, TCP/IP designers Bob Kahn
              and Vint Cerf, wrote in Gore’s defense in 2000. They argue that
              Gore was “the first political leader to recognize the importance
              of the internet and to promote and support its development.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of
              high speedtelecommunications,” the pair wrote. “As a Senator in
              the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at
              the time were several dozen different and unconnected networks
              into an ‘Interagency Network.’” Gore sponsored the 1991 High
              Performance Computing and Communications Act, which Kahn and Cerf
              say “became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the
              internet beyond the field of computer science.“

              No one runs the internet. It’s organized as a decentralized
              network of networks. Thousands of companies, universities,
              governments, and other entities operate their own networks and
              exchange traffic with each other based on voluntary
              interconnection agreements.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shared technical standards that make the internet work are
              managed by an organization called the Internet Engineering Task
              Force. The IETF is an open organization; anyone is free to attend
              meetings, propose new standards, and recommend changes to existing
              standards. No one is required to adopt standards endorsed by the
              IETF, but the IETF’s consensus-based decision-making process helps
              to ensure that its recommendations are generally adopted by the
              internet community.

              The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is
              sometimes described as being responsible for internet governance.
              As its name implies, ICANN is in charge of distributing domain
              names (like vox.com) and IP addresses. But ICANN doesn’t control
              who can connect to the internet or what kind of information can be

          <h1>IP address</h1>
          <div class="info-content">
            <h2>What’s an IP address?</h2>
            <p>
              Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to
              identify each other on the internet. For example, an IP address
              for vox.com is 216.146.46.10.
            </p>
            <p>
              An ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers
              Authority is responsible for distributing IP addresses to ensure
              that two different organizations don’t use the same address.
            </p>

            <h2>What is IPv6?</h2>
            <p>
              TThe current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for
              about 4 billion IP addresses. This was considered a very big
              number in the 1970s, but today, the supply of IPv4 addresses is
              nearly exhausted.
            </p>
            <p>
              So internet engineers have developed a new standard called IPv6.
              IPv6 allows for a mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the
              exact figure is 39 digits long — ensuring that the world will
              never again run out.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, the transition to IPv6 was slow. Technical work on the
              standard was completed in the 1990s, but the internet community
              faced a serious chicken-and-egg problem: as long as most people
              were using IPv4, there was little incentive for anyone to switch
              to IPv6.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as IPv4 addresses became scarce, IPv6 adoption accelerated.
              The fraction of users who connected to Google via IPv6 grew from 1
              percent at the beginning of 2013 to 6 percent in mid-2015.

          <h1>Internet operation</h1>
          <div class="info-content">
            <h2>How does wireless internet work?</h2>
            <p>
              In its early years, internet access was carried over physical
              cables. But more recently, wireless internet access has become
              increasingly common.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two basic types of wireless internet access: wifi and
              cellular. Wifi networks are relatively simple. Anyone can purchase
              wifi networking equipment in order to provide internet access in a
              home or business. Wifi networks use unlicensed spectrum:
              electromagnetic frequencies that are available for anyone to use
              without charge. To prevent neighbors’ networks from interfering
              with each other, there are strict limits on the power (and
              therefore the range) of wifi networks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cellular networks are more centralized. They work by breaking up
              the service territory into cells. In the densest areas, cells can
              be as small as a single city block; in rural areas a cell can be
              miles across. Each cell has a tower at its center providing
              services to devices there. When a device moves from one cell to
              another, the network automatically hands off the device from one
              tower to another, allowing the user to continue communicating
              without interruption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cells are too large to use the unlicensed, low-power spectrum used
              by wifi networks. Instead, cellular networks use spectrum licensed
              for their exclusive use. Because this spectrum is scarce, it is
              usually awarded by auction. Wireless auctions have generated tens
              of billions of dollars in revenue for the US treasury since the
              first one was held in 1994.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the cloud?</h2>
            <p>
              The cloud describes an approach to computing that has become
              popular in the early 2000s. By storing files on servers and
              delivering software over the internet, cloud computing provides
              users with a simpler, more reliable computing experience. Cloud
              computing allows consumers and businesses to treat computing as a
              utility, leaving the technical details to technology companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in the 1990s, many people used Microsoft Office to
              edit documents and spreadsheets. They stored documents on their
              hard drives. And when a new version of Microsoft Office was
              released, customers had to purchase it and manually install it on
              their PCs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, Google Docs is a cloud office suite. When a user
              visits docs.google.com, she automatically gets the latest version
              of Google Docs. Because her files are stored on Google’s servers,
              they’re available from any computer. Even better, she doesn’t have
              to worry about losing her files in a hard drive crash. (Microsoft
              now has its own cloud office suite called Office 365.)
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many other examples. Gmail and Hotmail are cloud email
              services that have largely replaced desktop email clients such as
              Outlook. Dropbox is a cloud computing service that automatically
              synchronizes data between devices, saving people from having to
              carry files around on floppy disks. Apple’s iCloud automatically
              copies users’ music and other files from their desktop computer to
              their mobile devices, saving users the hassle of synchronizing via
              a USB connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud computing is having a big impact for businesses too. In the
              1990s, companies wanting to create a website needed to purchase
              and operate their own servers. But in 2006, Amazon.com launched
              Amazon Web Services, which allows customers to rent servers by the
              hour. That has lowered the barrier to entry for creating websites
              and made it much easier for sites to quickly expand capacity as
              they grow more popular.
            </p>
            <h2>What is a packet?</h2>
            <p>
              A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the
              internet. Splitting information up into small, digestible pieces
              allows the network’s capacity to be used more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              A packet has two parts. The header contains information that helps
              the packet get to its destination, including the length of the
              packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value that
              helps the recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit.
              After the header comes the actual data. A packet can contain up to
              64 kilobytes of data, which is roughly 20 pages of plain text.
            </p>
            <p>
              If internet routers experience congestion or other technical
              problems, they are allowed to deal with it by simply discarding
              packets. It’s the sending computer’s responsibility to detect that
              a packet didn’t reach its destination and send another copy. This
              approach might seem counterintuitive, but it simplifies the
              internet’s core infrastructure, leading to higher performance at
              lower cost.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
            <p>
              The World Wide Web is a popular way to publish information on the
              internet. The web was created by Timothy Berners-Lee, a computer
              programmer at the European scientific research organization CERN,
              in 1991. It offered a more powerful and user-friendly interface
              than other internet applications. The web supported hyperlinks,
              allowing users to browse from one document to another with a
              single click.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, the web became increasingly sophisticated, supporting
              images, audio, video, and interactive content. In the mid-1990s,
              companies such as Yahoo and Amazon.com began building profitable
              businesses based on the web. In the 2000s, full-featured web-based
              applications such as Yahoo Maps and Google Docs were created.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
              to be the web’s official standards organization. He is still the
              W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of web
              standards. However, the web is an open platform, and the W3C can’t
              compel anyone to adopt its recommendations. In practice, the
              organizations with the most influence over the web are Microsoft,
              Google, Apple, and Mozilla, the companies that produce the leading
              web browsers. Any technologies adopted by these four become de
              facto web standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web has become so popular that many people now regard it as
              synonymous with the internet itself. But technically, the web is
              just one of many internet applications. Other applications include
              email and BitTorrent.

          <div class="info-content">
            <h2>What’s a web browser?</h2>
            <p>
              A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download
              and view websites. Web browsers are available for desktop
              computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first widely used browser was Mosaic, created by researchers
              at the University of Illinois. The Mosaic team moved to California
              to found Netscape, which built the first commercially successful
              web browser in 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
              Netscape’s popularity was soon eclipsed by Microsoft’s Internet
              Explorer, but an open source version of Netscape’s browser became
              the modern Firefox browser. Apple released its Safari browser in
              2003, and Google released a browser called Chrome in 2008. By
              2015, Chrome had grown to be the most popular web browser with a
              market share around 50 percent. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
              Safari also had significant market share.
            </p>
            <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
            <p>
              SSL, short for Secure Sockets Layer, is a family of encryption
              technologies that allows web users to protect the privacy of
              information they transmit over the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you visit a secure website such as Gmail.com, you'll see a
              lock next to the URL, indicating that your communications with the
              site are encrypted. Here's what that looks like in Google's Chrome
              browser:
            </p>
            <div class="container">
              <span class="image-container">
                <img
                  src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4269173/Screen_Shot_2014-04-08_at_10.55.39_AM.png"
                  alt="SSL"
                />
                <span class="caption">SSL</span>
              </span>
            </div>
            <p>
              That lock is supposed to signal that third parties won't be able
              to read any information you send or receive. Under the hood, SSL
              accomplishes that by transforming your data into a coded message
              that only the recipient knows how to decipher. If a malicious
              party is listening to the conversation, it will only see a
              seemingly random string of characters, not the contents of your
              emails, Facebook posts, credit card numbers, or other private
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              SSL was introduced by Netscape in 1994. In its early years, it was
              only used on a few types of websites, such as online banking
              sites. By the early 2010s, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook all used
              SSL encryption for their websites and online services. More
              recently, there has been a movement toward making the use of SSL
              universal. In 2015, Mozilla announced that future versions of the
              Firefox browser would treat the lack of SSL encryption as a
              security flaw, as a way to encourage all websites to upgrade.
              Google is considering taking the same step with Chrome.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the Domain Name System?</h2>
            <p>
              The Domain Name System (DNS) is the reason you can access Vox by
              typing vox.com into your browser rather than a hard-to-remember
              numeric address such as 216.146.46.10.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system is hierarchical. For example, the .com domain is
              administered by a company called Verisign. Verisign assigns
              sub-domains like google.com and vox.com. Owners of these
              second-level domains, in turn, can create sub-domains such as
              mail.google.com and maps.google.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because popular websites use domain names to identify themselves
              to the public, the security of DNS has become an increasing
              concern. Criminals and government spies alike have sought to
              compromise DNS in order to impersonate popular websites such as
              facebook.com and gmail.com and intercept their private
              communications. A standard called DNSSEC seeks to beef up DNS
              security with encryption, but few people have adopted it.
            </p>
            <h2>Who decides what domain names exist and who gets them?</h2>
            <p>
              The domain name system is administered by the Internet Corporation
              for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization
              based in California. ICANN was founded in 1998. It was granted
              authority over DNS by the US Commerce Department, though it has
              increasingly asserted its independence from the US government.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of domain names. The first is generic
              top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .com, .edu, .org, and .gov.
              Because the internet originated in the United States, these
              domains tend to be most popular there. Authority over these
              domains is usually delegated to private organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Each
              country in the world has its own 2-letter code. For example, the
              ccTLD for the United States is .us, Great Britain’s is .uk, and
              China’s is .cn. These domains are administered by authorities in
              each country. Some ccTLDs, such as .tv (for the island nation of
              Tuvalu) and .io (the British Indian Ocean Territory), have become
              popular for use outside of their home countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2011, ICANN voted to make it easier to create new gTLDs. As a
              result, there may be dozens or even hundreds of new domains in the
              next few years.
