        <h1>The internet</h1>
        <div class="info-content">
            <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
            <p>The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as an academic research project
                in 1969, and became a global commercial network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more than 2
                billion people around the world.</p>
            <p>The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the internet or controls who can
                connect to it. Instead, thousands of different organizations operate their own networks and
                negotiate voluntary interconnection agreements.</p>
            <p>Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed, the web has become so popular that
                many people incorrectly treat the internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is
                just one of many internet applications. Other popular Internet applications include email and
                BitTorrent.</p>
            <h2>Where is the internet?</h2>
            <p>The internet has three basic parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the
                        internet. Currently, about 60 percent of residential internet connections in the United
                        States are provided by cable TV companies such as Comcast and Time Warner. Of the remaining
                        40 percent, a growing fraction use new fiber optic cables, most of which are part of
                        Verizon’s FiOS program or AT&T’s U-Verse. Finally, a significant but shrinking number use
                        outdated DSL service provided over telephone cables.</p>
                    <p>The last mile also includes the towers that allow people to access the internet with their
                        cell phones. Wireless internet service accounts for a large and growing share of all
                        internet usage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content.
                    Some are owned by large companies such as Google and Facebook. Others are commercial facilities
                    that provide service to many smaller websites. Data centers have very fast internet connections,
                    allowing them to serve many users simultaneously. Data centers can be located anywhere in the
                    world, but they are often located in remote areas where land and electricity are cheap. For
                    example, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.</li>
                <li>The backbone consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data
                    between data centers and consumers. The backbone market is highly competitive. Backbone
                    providers frequently connect their networks together at internet exchange points, usually
                    located in major cities. Establishing a presence at IEPs makes it much easier for backbone
                    providers to improve their connections to others.</li>
