        <div class="info-content">
            <h2>How does wireless internet work?</h2>
            <p>In its early years, internet access was carried over physical cables. But more recently, wireless
                internet access has become increasingly common.</p>
            <p>There are two basic types of wireless internet access: wifi and cellular. Wifi networks are
                relatively simple. Anyone can purchase wifi networking equipment in order to provide internet access
                in a home or business. Wifi networks use unlicensed spectrum: electromagnetic frequencies that are
                available for anyone to use without charge. To prevent neighbors’ networks from interfering with
                each other, there are strict limits on the power (and therefore the range) of wifi networks.</p>
            <p>Cellular networks are more centralized. They work by breaking up the service territory into cells. In
                the densest areas, cells can be as small as a single city block; in rural areas a cell can be miles
                across. Each cell has a tower at its center providing services to devices there. When a device moves
                from one cell to another, the network automatically hands off the device from one tower to another,
                allowing the user to continue communicating without interruption.</p>
            <p>Cells are too large to use the unlicensed, low-power spectrum used by wifi networks. Instead,
                cellular networks use spectrum licensed for their exclusive use. Because this spectrum is scarce, it
                is usually awarded by auction. Wireless auctions have generated tens of billions of dollars in
                revenue for the US treasury since the first one was held in 1994.</p>
            <h2>What is the cloud?</h2>
            <p>The cloud describes an approach to computing that has become popular in the early 2000s. By storing
                files on servers and delivering software over the internet, cloud computing provides users with a
                simpler, more reliable computing experience. Cloud computing allows consumers and businesses to
                treat computing as a utility, leaving the technical details to technology companies.</p>
            <p>For example, in the 1990s, many people used Microsoft Office to edit documents and spreadsheets. They
                stored documents on their hard drives. And when a new version of Microsoft Office was released,
                customers had to purchase it and manually install it on their PCs.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Google Docs is a cloud office suite. When a user visits docs.google.com, she
                automatically gets the latest version of Google Docs. Because her files are stored on Google’s
                servers, they’re available from any computer. Even better, she doesn’t have to worry about losing
                her files in a hard drive crash. (Microsoft now has its own cloud office suite called Office 365.)
            </p>
            <p>There are many other examples. Gmail and Hotmail are cloud email services that have largely replaced
                desktop email clients such as Outlook. Dropbox is a cloud computing service that automatically
                synchronizes data between devices, saving people from having to carry files around on floppy disks.
                Apple’s iCloud automatically copies users’ music and other files from their desktop computer to
                their mobile devices, saving users the hassle of synchronizing via a USB connection.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing is having a big impact for businesses too. In the 1990s, companies wanting to create
                a website needed to purchase and operate their own servers. But in 2006, Amazon.com launched Amazon
                Web Services, which allows customers to rent servers by the hour. That has lowered the barrier to
                entry for creating websites and made it much easier for sites to quickly expand capacity as they
                grow more popular.</p>
            <h2>What is a packet?</h2>
            <p>A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the internet. Splitting information up
                into small, digestible pieces allows the network’s capacity to be used more efficiently.</p>
            <p>A packet has two parts. The header contains information that helps the packet get to its destination,
                including the length of the packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value that helps the
                recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. After the header comes the actual data. A
                packet can contain up to 64 kilobytes of data, which is roughly 20 pages of plain text.</p>
            <p>If internet routers experience congestion or other technical problems, they are allowed to deal with
                it by simply discarding packets. It’s the sending computer’s responsibility to detect that a packet
                didn’t reach its destination and send another copy. This approach might seem counterintuitive, but
                it simplifies the internet’s core infrastructure, leading to higher performance at lower cost.</p>
            <h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web is a popular way to publish information on the internet. The web was created by
                Timothy Berners-Lee, a computer programmer at the European scientific research organization CERN, in
                1991. It offered a more powerful and user-friendly interface than other internet applications. The
                web supported hyperlinks, allowing users to browse from one document to another with a single click.
            </p>
            <p>Over time, the web became increasingly sophisticated, supporting images, audio, video, and
                interactive content. In the mid-1990s, companies such as Yahoo and Amazon.com began building
                profitable businesses based on the web. In the 2000s, full-featured web-based applications such as
                Yahoo Maps and Google Docs were created.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to be the web’s official standards
                organization. He is still the W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of web
                standards. However, the web is an open platform, and the W3C can’t compel anyone to adopt its
                recommendations. In practice, the organizations with the most influence over the web are Microsoft,
                Google, Apple, and Mozilla, the companies that produce the leading web browsers. Any technologies
                adopted by these four become de facto web standards.</p>
            <p>The web has become so popular that many people now regard it as synonymous with the internet itself.
                But technically, the web is just one of many internet applications. Other applications include email
                and BitTorrent.</p>
