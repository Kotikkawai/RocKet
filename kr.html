        <h1>Web browser</h1>
        <div class="info-content">
            <h2>What’s a web browser?</h2>
            <p>A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and view websites. Web browsers are
                available for desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>
            <p>The first widely used browser was Mosaic, created by researchers at the University of Illinois. The
                Mosaic team moved to California to found Netscape, which built the first commercially successful web
                browser in 1994.</p>
            <p>Netscape’s popularity was soon eclipsed by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, but an open source version
                of Netscape’s browser became the modern Firefox browser. Apple released its Safari browser in 2003,
                and Google released a browser called Chrome in 2008. By 2015, Chrome had grown to be the most
                popular web browser with a market share around 50 percent. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari
                also had significant market share.</p>
            <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
            <p>SSL, short for Secure Sockets Layer, is a family of encryption technologies that allows web users to
                protect the privacy of information they transmit over the internet.</p>
            <p>When you visit a secure website such as Gmail.com, you'll see a lock next to the URL, indicating that
                your communications with the site are encrypted. Here's what that looks like in Google's Chrome
                browser:</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <span class="image-container">
                        <img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4269173/Screen_Shot_2014-04-08_at_10.55.39_AM.png"
                            alt="SSL">
                        <span class="caption">SSL</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
            <p>That lock is supposed to signal that third parties won't be able to read any information you send or
                receive. Under the hood, SSL accomplishes that by transforming your data into a coded message that
                only the recipient knows how to decipher. If a malicious party is listening to the conversation, it
                will only see a seemingly random string of characters, not the contents of your emails, Facebook
                posts, credit card numbers, or other private information.</p>
            <p>SSL was introduced by Netscape in 1994. In its early years, it was only used on a few types of
                websites, such as online banking sites. By the early 2010s, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook all used SSL
                encryption for their websites and online services. More recently, there has been a movement toward
                making the use of SSL universal. In 2015, Mozilla announced that future versions of the Firefox
                browser would treat the lack of SSL encryption as a security flaw, as a way to encourage all
                websites to upgrade. Google is considering taking the same step with Chrome.</p>
        <h2>What is the Domain Name System?</h2>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the reason you can access Vox by typing vox.com into your browser rather than a hard-to-remember numeric address such as 216.146.46.10.</p>
        <p>The system is hierarchical. For example, the .com domain is administered by a company called Verisign. Verisign assigns sub-domains like google.com and vox.com. Owners of these second-level domains, in turn, can create sub-domains such as mail.google.com and maps.google.com.</p>
        <p>Because popular websites use domain names to identify themselves to the public, the security of DNS has become an increasing concern. Criminals and government spies alike have sought to compromise DNS in order to impersonate popular websites such as facebook.com and gmail.com and intercept their private communications. A standard called DNSSEC seeks to beef up DNS security with encryption, but few people have adopted it.</p>
        <h2>Who decides what domain names exist and who gets them?</h2>
        <p>The domain name system is administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization based in California. ICANN was founded in 1998. It was granted authority over DNS by the US Commerce Department, though it has increasingly asserted its independence from the US government.</p>
        <p>There are two types of domain names. The first is generic top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .com, .edu, .org, and .gov. Because the internet originated in the United States, these domains tend to be most popular there. Authority over these domains is usually delegated to private organizations.</p>
        <p>There are also country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Each country in the world has its own 2-letter code. For example, the ccTLD for the United States is .us, Great Britain’s is .uk, and China’s is .cn. These domains are administered by authorities in each country. Some ccTLDs, such as .tv (for the island nation of Tuvalu) and .io (the British Indian Ocean Territory), have become popular for use outside of their home countries.</p>
        <p>In 2011, ICANN voted to make it easier to create new gTLDs. As a result, there may be dozens or even hundreds of new domains in the next few years.</p>
